This was mostly a code along React project, as it was my first React project after a simple to do list.
I do not take credit for the css, nor coming up with most of the game logic, though I did code it up and understand each aspect.
After completing the project, I added my own custom features including:
-Tracking and displaying the number of rolls it takes to win
-Tracking and displaying the time it takes to win
-Storing and displaying these records using local storage
